# AnkiDecking - Automated flashcard generation

This project is based on [this wonderful article](https://www.juliensobczak.com/write/2016/12/26/anki-scripting.html)
written by Julien Sobczak. I started it to generate myself an even bigger [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) deck than
was previously available for learning Finnish. Additional resources used in the process include a frequency list of
Finnish words obtained from the [CSC IT Center for Science](https://web.archive.org/web/20140807150829/http://www.csc.fi/tutkimus/alat/kielitiede/taajuussanasto-B9996/view)
and a [dump](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiktionary/20200420/enwiktionary-20200420-pages-articles.xml.bz2) of the
English Wiktionary taken from [here](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiktionary/20200420/).
